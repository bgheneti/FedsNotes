Milestone 2
=========
<br>

1.     Since milestone 1 my complete idea for the site changed this was majoritarily caused by one of my teammates deciding to quit the class, causing the break up of my team. For this reason I decided to design a simpler app, not in the competition, for posting pdf file notes online and sharing them with others. This site, fed's notes, allows one to upload noted into chapters by class, grade, and description. As of now classes, grades, and descriptions can be posted with notes and note files can be uploaded although a download feature is still being impletemented. On the site users can view their own notes as well as all featured notes and all notes available on the siteleft window and watch the results in the right.  
2.    note posts can be made with subject, grade, and description listings. Files can be uploaded to the database. Notes can be edit. One's posts can be viewed as well as those of all other users and featured posts. A login system works. The main issue is the downloading of files by chapter. By that I mean that implementing a looping function in handlebars over chapters with fileIds has been problematic.
3. I hoped the file downloading feature could have been implemented.
4. I hope to create the ability to edit/delete chapter titles and files, share one's notes on facebook, filter notes by search, and use a node library to view pdfs online.
5. I'm using meteor with iron-router, and mongodB.
6. I'm using Jquery,Handlebars,meteor.
7. Google Chrome. I hope to adapt it for mobile chrome users as well.
8. the loading times on deployed meteor.com app versions, using the bugy error prone windows version of meteor, and limitations of handlebars looping over nested arrays and objects.
